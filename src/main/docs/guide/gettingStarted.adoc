In this guide, you explore Controller Testing in Grails. We are going
to focus on some of the most common use cases:

**Unit Tests**

* Validate allowed methods.
* Validate _model_, _views_, _status_ and _redirect_
* Use a Stub when you work with a service
* Validate HTTP parameters bind to a command object
* Validate a JSON payload is bound to a command object

**Functional Tests**

- JSON response, status code
